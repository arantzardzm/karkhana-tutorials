## Challenge 1: Fostering independent learning in students through multimedia materials

One of the main goals of Karkhana over the past few years has been to create a learning environment that is as self directed as possible. 
Essentially an environment where students take responsibility of their own learning. 
Learning independently can be challenging, even for the brightest and the most motivated students.  

We are looking to design support materials for the students to help them learn using  our kits independently. 
Some of the things that you might want to keep in mind designing the support materials:  

1. What is the best medium of instructions (blogs, videos etc) for students? 
Is it a single medium or a mix of mediums? How do the different material connect to each other? 
Are they sequenced or independent of each other? Are they linked through an explicit path or only in implicit ways? 
How much of the support material will you create on your own and how much can be repurposed from already existing content online?  

2. How do we provide these middle school students with engaging and student-centered instructions?  

3. What strategies are you using to encourage self management and self evaluation?  

4. The theoretical readings you have done so far indicate that ability to learn in a social and connected setting is effective and natural.   

5. What strategies will your design use to encourage students to collaborate, share and do peer support? How do you encourage students to document their work?
